            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
                <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
                <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
