            <li><p>Heat olive oil in a large, high-sided sauté pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and sauté until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, if using, and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Carefully pour in the crushed tomatoes. Add the salt and pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in the cream. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper as needed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook al dente, about 10 minutes or according to package instructions.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Toss gently to combine. Add the basil, toss once more, and serve immediately with grated cheese.</p></li>
